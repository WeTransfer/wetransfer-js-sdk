## Installation

Install the SDK with:

```bash
npm i @wetransfer/js-sdk --save
```

## Getting started

In order to be able to use the SDK and access our public APIs, you must provide an API key, which is available in our [Developers Portal](https://developers.wetransfer.com/).

This is the bare minimum code needed to create a transfer. Copy and paste into a file, place your API Key there, and run with `node path/to/file.js`. VoilÃ , you just created your very first transfer!

```javascript
const createWTClient = require('@wetransfer/js-sdk');

(async function() {
  // An authorization call is made when you create the client.
  // Keep that in mind to perform this operation
  // in the most suitable part of your code
  const wtClient = await createWTClient('/* YOUR PRIVATE API KEY GOES HERE*/');

  const content = Buffer.from('Look ma, a transfer!');
  const transfer = await wtClient.transfer.create({
    message: 'My very first transfer!',
    files: [
      {
        name: 'hello.txt',
        size: content.length,
        content: content
      }
    ]
  });

  console.log(transfer.url)
})();
```

## Transfers

Built to get files from one place to the other, this is the classic WeTransfer experience. Send it up to 2GB of files per transfer and this thing will handle it with ease, with a built-in 7 day expiry.

### Create a transfer

Transfers must be created with files. Once the transfer has been created and finalized, new files cannot be added to it. When creating a transfer you must provide a list of files you want to transfer. Files must include `name` (unique) and `size` (in bytes) properties.

```js
const transfer = await wtClient.transfer.create({
  // Message is optional
  message: 'My very first transfer!',
  // Files are mandatory. Must include file names (unique!) and file sizes, in bytes.
  files: [
    {
      name: 'hello.txt',
      size: 1024
    },
    {
      name: 'big-bobis.jpg',
      size: 13370099
    }
  ]
});
```

As you can see, the content of the files has not been included as a part of the payload. The contend is not a required property because depending on your use case, you will have access to the file content when the transfer is created, but in other cases, this can be separate process.

These are some possible options:

1. You are writing a CLI tool, where you know where the files are located, our you just expect paths to files that you need to read before you create the transfer. If that's the case, the content will be a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer), returned by `fs.readFile` method. The SDK will take care of the file upload process, we get you covered. Your code will be something like that, if you know the path of the file:

```js
// Create a promise-based function to read files.
function readFile(path) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fs.readFile(path, (error, data) => {
      if (error) {
        return reject(error);
      }

      resolve(data);
    });
  });
}

// This is variable, and will depend on your application.
const filePaths = ['path/to/file.txt', 'path/to/image.png'];

// Read the content of the files, in parallel
const fileContents = await Promise.all(filePaths.map(readFile));

// Create the files array with names, sizes and content.
const files = filePaths.map((file, index) => {
  const content = fileContents[index];
  return {
    name: name: file.split('/').pop(),
    size: content.length,
    content: content
  };
});

const transfer = await wtClient.transfer.create({
  message: 'My very first transfer!',
  files: files
});

console.log(transfer.url); // https://we.tl/t-Sa7dYYlOdF
```

2. If you are trying to create a transfer from the browser, please make use of the [File Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), which gives you access to file information and content. Be aware that using the SDK directly in the browser, will expose your API Key to the wild, and this is not desired. Considering that you have am input to upload multiple files:

```html
<input type="file" id="files-input" multiple />
```

```js
const filesElement = document.getElementById('files-input');

// Create a transfer everytime files are selected.
filesElement.addEventListener('change', async (event) => {
  const fileList = event.target.files;

  const files = fileList.map((file) => {
    return {
      name: file.name,
      size: file.size,
      content: file
    };
  });

  const transfer = await wtClient.transfer.create({
    message: 'My very first transfer!',
    files: files
  });

  console.log(transfer.url); // https://we.tl/t-Sa7dYYlOdF
});
```

3. A proper solution for the previous example would be to have a client/server application, where your API Key is not exposed in the browser, and you can control which clients can create transfers thanks to CORS settings, for example. That requires a more complicated setup, but it's the best solution both in terms of security and performance. The process is as follows:

    1. Create a transfer, specifing only file names and size.
    2. Request upload URLs for each part of the file.
    3. Complete the file upload.
    4. Repeat 2 and 3 for each file.
    5. Complete the transfer. The final WeTransfer URL will be returned here.

    Please check this [complete example]() using vanilla JS for the client and Express as a Node.js server. 

### Find a transfer

If you have a transfer id saved from previous steps, you can retrieve the transfer object and files information:

```js
const transfer = await wtClient.transfer.find('/* your transfer_id */');
console.log(transfer.url); // https://we.tl/t-Sa7dYYlOdF
```

## Boards

Our new Board API is in line with our new mobile app. It can store traditional files as well as links, and is flexible in how it displays it all.

### Create a board

Boards are the latest addition to our Public API. It was built with our iOS and Android apps in mind, but it's also suitable for web/desktop users. It is designed for collecting content rather than transmitting content from A to B (though it can do that, too) and it supports both files and links. Boards are created emtpy, without files or links. Imagine a board like an empty canvas where you can add items at any time.

























### Transfer

Transfers can be created with or without items. Once the transfer has been created, items can be added at any time:

```javascript
const transfer = await apiClient.transfer.create({
  name: 'My very first transfer!',
  // Description is optional.
  description: 'Something about cats, most probably.'
});
// transfer.shortened_url contains the public WeTransfer URL
```

### Add items to a transfer

Once a transfer has been created you can then add items (files or links) to it. If you are adding files to the transfer, the files are not uploaded at this point, but in the next step.

```javascript
const files = await apiClient.transfer.addFiles(transfer, [{
  filename: 'kittie.gif',
  filesize: 1024
}]);

const links = await apiClient.transfer.addLinks(transfer, [{
  url: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan',
  meta: {
    title: 'Japan'
  }
}]);
```

Each method will return an array of objects for each item that was added to the transfer. For files, this objects will be used to upload the correspondent file to the transfer, as explained in the next section.

### Upload a file

Once the file has been added to the transfer, next step is to upload the file or files. You must provide the content of the file to upload as a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer), we will NOT read the file for you. The content of the file will be splited and uploaded in chunks of 5MB to our S3 bucket.

```javascript
// Depending on your application, you will read the file using fs.readFile
// or it will be a file uploaded to your web server.
const fileContent = [/* Buffer */];
await Promise.all(
  // files is the variable returned by apiClient.transfer.addFiles method
  files.map((item) => apiClient.transfer.uploadFile(item, fileContent))
);
```

### Request an upload URL

The previous steps work well for an environment where accessing the files directly is possible, like a CLI tool. In a web environment, we don't want to upload the files to the server, and from there, upload them to S3, but upload them directly from the client. `apiClient.file.getUploadUrl` method will create the necessary upload URL for a given part.

```js
// This code lives on the browser
async function uploadFile(item, content) {
  const MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 6 * 1024 * 1024;
  for (let partNumber = 0; partNumber < item.meta.multipart_parts; partNumber++) {
    const chunkStart = partNumber * MAX_CHUNK_SIZE;
    const chunkEnd = (partNumber + 1) * MAX_CHUNK_SIZE;

    const multipartItem = await fetch('https://yourserver.com/create-upload-url', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        file_id: item.id.
        multipart_upload_id: item.meta.multipart_upload_id,
        part_number: partNumber
      })
    });
    
    await fetch(multipartItem.upload_url, {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: content.slice(chunkStart, chunkEnd)
    });
  }
};
```

```js
// This code lives on the server. This is an express controller.
router.post('/create-upload-url', async (req, res) => {
  const { file_id, multipart_upload_id , part_number } = req.params;
  const uploadUrl = await apiClient.file.getUploadUrl({
    id: file_id,
    meta: {
      multipart_upload_id
    }
  }, part_number);

  res.json(uploadUrl);
})
```

## Logging levels

Logging levels in this SDK conform to the severity ordering specified by [RFC5424]: _severity of all levels is assumed to be numerically **ascending** from most important to least important._

Each `level` is given a specific integer priority. The higher the priority the more important the message is considered to be, and the lower the corresponding integer priority.

``` js
{ 
  error: 0, 
  warn: 1, 
  info: 2, 
  verbose: 3, 
  debug: 4, 
  silly: 5 
}
```

We make use of the `npm` levels showed above.

Setting the level for your logging message can be done providing the value when creating WeTransfer. For example, using the `warn` level you could log `warn` messages and below to the console, which in this case will only be `warn` and `error`.

```js
const apiClient = await createWTClient('/* YOUR PRIVATE API KEY GOES HERE*/', {
  logger: {
    level: 'debug'
  }
});
```

If no value is provided, by default we will use `info`.
