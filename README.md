The JavaScript SDK provides convenient access to WeTransfer's Public API.

## Installation

Install the SDK with:

```bash
npm i @wetransfer/js-sdk --save
```

## Usage

In order to be able to use the SDK and access our public APIs, you must provide an API key, which is available in our [Developers Portal](https://developers.wetransfer.com/).

```javascript
const createWTClient = require('@wetransfer/js-sdk');
// An authorization call is made when you create the client.
// Keep that in mind to perform this operation
// in the most suitable part of your code
const apiClient = await createWTClient('/* YOUR PRIVATE API KEY GOES HERE*/');

const transfer = await apiClient.transfer.create({
  name: 'My very first transfer!'
});
```

### Transfer

How to create a transfer, with no items yet:

```javascript
const transfer = await apiClient.transfer.create({
  name: 'My very first transfer!',
  description: ''
});
```

### Add some items

Items can be added to a transfer at any time:

```javascript
const items = await apiClient.transfer.addItems(transfer.id, [{
  content_identifier: 'file',
  local_identifier: '',
  filename: '',
  filesize: '',
  path: path.join(__dirname, './path/to/my-file.jpg'),
}]);
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `yarn` to install all dependencies. To run all tests:

```bash
$ npm test
$ npm run test:watch
```

## Release process

First, make sure that you have a NPM account at [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/), and you are part of the WeTransfer developer's team. Use `npm login` to store the credentials on the client aka, your computer. Check that your authentication token for `registry.npmjs.org` is part of your `~/.npmrc` file.

We use `semantic-release` to manage release process. Please run `npm run release:dry` to check relevant changes and possible new versions. If you are happy with it, run `npm run release`, it should do the following:

* Verify authentication for registry
* Verify GitHub authentication
* Find latest release and associated git tag
* Find last commits since last release
* Generate release notes
* Create Git tag
* Prepare the package and release it ðŸ“¦
