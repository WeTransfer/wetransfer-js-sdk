The JavaScript SDK provides convenient access to WeTransfer's Public API.

## Installation

Install the SDK with:

```bash
npm i @wetransfer/js-sdk --save
```

## Usage

In order to be able to use the SDK and access our public APIs, you must provide an API key, which is available in our [Developers Portal](https://developers.wetransfer.com/).

You can find a complete working example [here](https://github.com/WeTransfer/wt-js-sdk/blob/master/example/create-transfer.js).

```javascript
const createWTClient = require('@wetransfer/js-sdk');

(async function() {
  // An authorization call is made when you create the client.
  // Keep that in mind to perform this operation
  // in the most suitable part of your code
  const apiClient = await createWTClient('/* YOUR PRIVATE API KEY GOES HERE*/');

  const transfer = await apiClient.transfer.create({
    name: 'My very first transfer!'
  });
})();
```

### Transfer

Transfers can be created with or without items. Once the transfer has been created, items can be added at any time:

```javascript
const transfer = await apiClient.transfer.create({
  name: 'My very first transfer!',
  // Description is optional.
  description: 'Something about cats, most probably.'
});
// transfer.shortened_url contains the public WeTransfer URL
```

### Add items to a transfer

Once a transfer has been created you can then add items (files or links) to it. If you are adding files to the transfer, the files are not uploaded at this point, but in the next step.

```javascript
const files = await apiClient.transfer.addFiles(transfer, [{
  filename: 'kittie.gif',
  filesize: 1024
}]);

const links = await apiClient.transfer.addLinks(transfer, [{
  url: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan',
  meta: {
    title: 'Japan'
  }
}]);
```

Each method will return an array of objects for each item that was added to the transfer. For files, this objects will be used to upload the correspondent file to the transfer, as explained in the next section.

### Upload a file

Once the file has been added to the transfer, next step is to upload the file or files. You must provide the content of the file to upload as a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer), we will NOT read the file for you. The content of the file will be splited and uploaded in chunks of 5MB to our S3 bucket.

```javascript
// Depending on your application, you will read the file using fs.readFile
// or it will be a file uploaded to your web server.
const fileContent = [/* Buffer */];
await Promise.all(
  // files is the variable returned by apiClient.transfer.addFiles method
  files.map((item) => apiClient.transfer.uploadFile(item, fileContent))
);
```

## Logging levels

Logging levels in this SDK conform to the severity ordering specified by [RFC5424]: _severity of all levels is assumed to be numerically **ascending** from most important to least important._

Each `level` is given a specific integer priority. The higher the priority the more important the message is considered to be, and the lower the corresponding integer priority.

``` js
{ 
  error: 0, 
  warn: 1, 
  info: 2, 
  verbose: 3, 
  debug: 4, 
  silly: 5 
}
```

We make use of the `npm` levels showed above.

Setting the level for your logging message can be done providing the value when creating WeTransfer. For example, using the `warn` level you could log `warn` messages and below to the console, which in this case will only be `warn` and `error`.

```js
const apiClient = await createWTClient('/* YOUR PRIVATE API KEY GOES HERE*/', {
  logger: {
    level: 'debug'
  }
});
```

If no value is provided, by default we will use `info`.

## Documentation

Visit [https://developers.wetransfer.com/documentation](https://developers.wetransfer.com/documentation) to access the latest API related documentation.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `yarn` to install all dependencies. To run all tests:

```bash
$ npm test
$ npm run test:watch
```

## Release process

First, make sure that you have a NPM account at [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/), and you are part of the WeTransfer developer's team. Use `npm login` to store the credentials on the client aka, your computer. Check that your authentication token for `registry.npmjs.org` is part of your `~/.npmrc` file.

We use `semantic-release` to manage release process. Please run `npm run release:dry` to check relevant changes and possible new versions. If you are happy with it, run `npm run release`, it should do the following:

* Verify authentication for registry
* Verify GitHub authentication
* Find latest release and associated git tag
* Find last commits since last release
* Generate release notes
* Create Git tag
* Prepare the package and release it ðŸ“¦
