The JavaScript SDK provides convenient access to WeTransfer's Public API.

## Installation

Install the SDK with:

```bash
npm i @wetransfer/js-sdk --save
```

## Usage

In order to be able to use the SDK and access our public APIs, you must provide an API key, which is available in our [Developers Portal](https://developers.wetransfer.com/).

```javascript
const createWTClient = require('@wetransfer/js-sdk');
// An authorization call is made when you create the client.
// Keep that in mind to perform this operation
// in the most suitable part of your code
const apiClient = await createWTClient('/* YOUR PRIVATE API KEY GOES HERE*/');

const transfer = await apiClient.transfer.create({
  name: 'My very first transfer!'
});
```

### Transfer

How to create a transfer, with no items yet:

```javascript
const transfer = await apiClient.transfer.create({
  name: 'My very first transfer!',
  description: ''
});
```

### Add some items

Items can be added to a transfer at any time:

```javascript
const items = await apiClient.transfer.addItems(transfer.id, [{
  content_identifier: 'file',
  local_identifier: '',
  filename: '',
  filesize: '',
  path: path.join(__dirname, './path/to/my-file.jpg'),
}]);
```
